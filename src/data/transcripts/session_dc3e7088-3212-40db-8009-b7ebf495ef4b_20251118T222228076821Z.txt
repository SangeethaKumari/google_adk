[20251118T222228076821Z] ASSISTANT: I’m sorry to hear about your discomfort. A localized rash with itching could be due to irritants, allergens, or even a minor infection—have you had any recent exposure to harsh chemicals, new skincare products, or insect bites? If the rash worsens, spreads, or doesn’t improve in a few days, it’s best to consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation. Take care!
