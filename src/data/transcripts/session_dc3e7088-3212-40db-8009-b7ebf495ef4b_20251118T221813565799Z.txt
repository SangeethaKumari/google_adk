[20251118T221813565799Z] ASSISTANT: I'm sorry to hear about your rash. Could you share more details, such as its location (palm, fingers, back of hand?), duration, and any associated symptoms like itching, pain, or redness? Also, have you recently used new products, been exposed to chemicals, or had insect bites? These details can help narrow down possible causes, but always consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis.
