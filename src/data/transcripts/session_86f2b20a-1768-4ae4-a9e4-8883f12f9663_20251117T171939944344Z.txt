[20251117T171939944344Z] ASSISTANT: It sounds like your rash might be related to the hiking trip—common causes include plant allergens (like poison ivy), insect bites, or friction. The burning sensation could indicate irritation or an allergic reaction. Avoid scratching to prevent infection, and consider washing the area thoroughly. If the rash spreads, worsens, or is accompanied by fever, consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation. 🌿
