[20251118T222407651303Z] ASSISTANT: To address your rash, start by avoiding potential irritants (e.g., harsh soaps, chemicals, or new products). Apply a soothing over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or antihistamine to reduce itching. If the rash worsens, spreads, or doesn’t improve within a few days, consult a healthcare provider to rule out infections, allergies, or other conditions. Take care, and don’t hesitate to seek professional advice if symptoms persist!
