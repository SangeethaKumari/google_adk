[20251117T180937364505Z] ASSISTANT: It sounds like an allergic reaction (e.g., poison ivy, insect bites, or plant contact) could be the culprit, especially with burning and itching. Avoid scratching to prevent infection, and clean the area gently with mild soap. If the rash spreads, becomes painful, or is accompanied by fever, consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation. 🌿
