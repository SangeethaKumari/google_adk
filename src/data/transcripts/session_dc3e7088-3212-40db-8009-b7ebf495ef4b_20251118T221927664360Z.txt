[20251118T221927664360Z] ASSISTANT: It sounds like a possible contact dermatitis or allergic reaction—have you used any new lotions, soaps, or cleaning agents recently? The itching and redness could indicate an irritant or allergic response. If the rash spreads, becomes painful, or doesn’t improve in a few days, it’s best to consult a healthcare provider to rule out infections or other conditions. Take care!
