[20251117T180931192582Z] ASSISTANT: It sounds like the rash might be an allergic reaction (like poison ivy) or insect bites, and scratching could worsen irritation or risk infection. Avoid scratching, and clean the area gently with mild soap. Apply a cold compress or over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to soothe the burning. If the rash spreads, becomes painful, or is accompanied by fever, see a healthcare provider promptly. 🌿
